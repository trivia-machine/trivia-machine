# Group Agreement

### Conflict Plan
    (Battle Royale with Pugil Sticks)

    - How will you be sure you are creating a safe environment?
      - be respectful and thoughtful
      - pause at the end of the conversation in case anyone has something else to say

    - What will you do when it encounters conflict?
      - 5 minute breather away from computers (everyone)
      - come back and discuss the issue

    - How will you raise concerns to members who aren’t contributing?
      - approach and ask if they need help (lost)?
      - stand-up to discuss tasks, and how can we help

    - What is your process to resolve conflicts?
      - can we check-in about this
      - define the issue one on one or as a group
      - my understanding was this? What is yours?
      - how can I/we help?

    - How will you excalate?
      - If still not addressed have a team meeting to figure out how to support

    - When to call a meeting?
      - Anyone can call a meeting at any time.

    - What constitutes agreement on an issue?
      - majority rule
      - If someone feels strongly about something, we would hear the other person out before making a decision.

      - Make sure everyone gets a chance to finish their sentences.
      - Verbal yes or no from everyone on decisions.
